### Set

>We are going to build out the Set capability while assuming that the rest of collections aren’t there. Internal array should have initial size of 10.

1. Size() returns 0 at start.
2. Add() appends item to Set.
3. After Add(), Size() returns new count.
4. Contains() returns false when Set does not contain item.
5. Contains() returns true when Set contains item.
6. Remove() removes item from Set.
7. On Add(), ignore duplicates.
8. More than 10 elements can be Add()-ed.
